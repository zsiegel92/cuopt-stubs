        This function can be used when the cost matrix is not acquirable due

        Between each route target locations, all the intermediate waypoints

        Compute a custom matrix over the passed weights and target locations.

        This is applied on shortest paths found during previous
        compute_cost_matrix call.

        This function allows setting a custom cost between waypoints (for
        example, time) and then getting the total cost it takes to go from one
        target location to all the others. The shortest paths are **not**
        recomputed. The path found from compute_cost_matrix between target
        locations stays the same but the new weight set is used to compute the
        output matrix.
